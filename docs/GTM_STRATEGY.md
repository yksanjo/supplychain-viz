## 🎤 Messaging Framework

### Positioning Statement

**For** mid-market manufacturers ($20M-$200M) who struggle with supply chain visibility,

**SupplyChainViz** is a cloud-based platform

**That** provides real-time visibility and AI-powered predictions

**Unlike** SAP or Kinaxis which cost $100K+ and take 6 months to implement,

**We** deliver enterprise-grade capabilities at mid-market prices with 2-week implementation.

### Key Messages by Audience

**For VP Operations:**
> "Stop finding out about delays when customers call. Predict disruptions 7-14 days in advance."

**For Supply Chain Managers:**
> "Get out of spreadsheet hell. One dashboard for all your suppliers, with AI doing the watching."

**For CFOs:**
> "Reduce inventory 15% while preventing stockouts. Typical ROI: 1,000%+ in year one."

**For CEOs:**
> "Enterprise supply chain visibility at a price that makes sense for mid-market."

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Mid-market manufacturers waste millions on excess inventory while still suffering stockouts. Enterprise supply chain software costs $100K+ and takes 6 months to implement—leaving them with spreadsheets.

SupplyChainViz gives them enterprise-grade visibility and AI predictions for $999/month, implemented in 2 weeks. We reduce inventory 15% and cut stockouts in half. Typical customer saves $400K in year one on a $12K investment."
